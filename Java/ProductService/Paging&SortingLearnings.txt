✅Page - Spring JPA supports inbuilt pagination

if consider filtering attributes, then we will have to write native query in JPA repository, we can't use
hibernate methods as filters can be dynamic and method construction for each kind needs to be defined.

mistakes -
sort.and(Sort.by(sortPair[0]));
✅Sort.and() method does not modify the existing Sort object. it returns a new Sort object,store the result
sort=sort.and(Sort.by(sortPair[0]));

✅dynamic sorting can also be done by-
List<Sort.Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();
orders.add(new Sort.Order(Sort.Direction.DESC, "price"));
Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by(orders));
