*** I was saving product along with category in 1 request, which gives error -
"save the transient instance before flushing"
Fix - in product model,use - @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
but this is not recommended, hard to debug, better to save category first and then product

✅findAllByCategory_Name -> JPA provides _ similar to . in java
  class product has category , category has name , single query will fetch all products of a category

✅@Query("select p from Product p where p.id = :id")
  findProductById(@Param("id") Long id) -> to write custom query in ORM format similar to sql format

✅
  used when need better optimisation than JPA inbuilt methods
