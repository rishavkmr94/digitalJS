@RequestMapping(name = "RISHAV", value = "/getProduct") - to create custom method like get,post

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.learn")  -- if controller are in different package ,
                               was stuck for long as mistakenly created controller in diffrent folder

@profile -  we can use spring profiles to load an implementor(incase  of multiple implementors) of service
            from property file(loose coupling)

DTO object - a service method should never take DTO, instead exact attributes or models as multiple controller can call
             and DTO are specific to a call to controller.

@configuration - used to create bean( object in spring container) to use it anywhere in api. EX- RestTTemplate by default is
                 not present as spring bean.we create config class.

Type Erasure concept -  in "get all products service" , java will not know what to convert from rest call JSON response as
                      type information used in generics is removed(erased) by the Java compiler during compilation.

@ControllerAdvice - instead of writing catch in controller use this. using @ExceptionHandler , we define for each kind
                    of custom exception what needs to be sent back.
