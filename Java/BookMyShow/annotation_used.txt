@Entity - to define the model class as a table in db
@Id - to define primary key in the model
@MappedSuperClass - not to have a seperate table for base model
@Enumerated(value = EnumType.STRING) - to store enum efficiently in sql
@ElementCollection - to store list of enum for a object ( movie has list of actors and actor is enum)
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "region") - who owns the relation, theatre will have column with region_id
                                    and no extra mapping table will be created

Solve basedmodel createTime and UpdateTime not coming issue -
@EnableJpaAuditing - in the main application
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) - in the base model
