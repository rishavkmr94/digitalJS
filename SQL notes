Q1. from customer table , print firstname, lastname , firstname for all the customers who have same surname?
    there should not be any redundant data EX:- "rishav kumar rishav" - is wrong, also if there is "rishav kumar aman" then "aman kumar rishav" is not valid

ans-> select c1.first_name,c1.last_name,c2.first_name from customer c1
      join customer c2 on c1.last_name=c2.last_name
      where c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id;

      we use "<" operator to match only 1 entry , if we use "<>" then we get "rishav kumar aman" then "aman kumar rishav"

Q2. diffrence between count(*) and count(coulumn)

ans->
    select original_language_id,count(*) from film                      -------> this group the null coulumns also and count it;
    group by original_language_id;

    select original_language_id,count(original_language_id) from film   --------> this will count only non-null rows, so null column count wiil be 0;
    group by original_language_id;
